# hello-world
Time to git rolling.

My goal is to retool from a professional historian into a full time tech writer and programmer. 
I am searching for a remote position in preparation for a move back to the states from Poland, where I currently live.

I'm hoping to find some straightforward, fair, work. Nothing spectacular, but something very much worth my time that will pay the bills (and then some) with a reasonable amount of time invested.
